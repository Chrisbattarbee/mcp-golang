# Pagination

MCP-Golang supports cursor-based pagination for listing tools, prompts, and resources. This allows clients to retrieve data in manageable chunks rather than all at once.

By default, pagination is disabled, but you can enable it with the `WithPaginationLimit` option.

<Warning>As of 2024-12-13, it looks like Claude does not support pagination yet.</Warning>

## How Pagination Works

If pagination is enabled, the server will limit the number of items returned in each response to the specified limit.

1. Limit the number of items returned to the specified limit
2. Include a `nextCursor` in the response if there are more items available
3. Accept a `cursor` parameter in subsequent requests to get the next page

## Enabling Pagination

Pagination is enabled by default with a limit of 2 items per page. You can modify this behavior when creating a new server:

```go
server := mcp_golang.NewServer(
    mcp_golang.WithPaginationLimit(5), // Set items per page to 5
)
```

To disable pagination entirely, set the pagination limit to nil:

```go
server := mcp_golang.NewServer(
    mcp_golang.WithPaginationLimit(nil), // Disable pagination
)
```

## Important Notes

1. The cursor is opaque and should be treated as a black box by clients
2. Cursors are valid only for the specific list operation they were generated for
3. As of 2024-12-13, Claude does not support pagination yet
4. The pagination limit applies to all list operations (tools, prompts, and resources)
